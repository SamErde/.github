## Default Community Health Files

This repository contains my default community health files, issue template, PR template, and issue picker configuration.

GitHub will automatically use these files for any repository that I create where I do not already have these supported files in the repository. Note: these files are *included* and shown, but are not automatically created in my repositories. A template repository should be used for that.

The following file types are supported:

- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- Discussion category forms
- FUNDING.yml
- GOVERNANCE.md
- Issue and pull request templates and *config.yml*
- SECURITY.md
- SUPPORT.md

Complete documentation for this feature can be found at [Creating a default community health file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
