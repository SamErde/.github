# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the project!

Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, your feedback and contributions are appreciated.

Please note there is a code of conduct. We expect that all community members will follow it in all of our interactions with the project.

## Contributing via Pull Requests

1. Create a fork of this project.
2. Create a new branch for each contribution you wish to make. Please do not mix multiple changes in one branch, as that makes it more difficult to review and validate.
3. Create a pull request with your branch after your contributions are complete. Be sure to describe the benefits of your contribution and how it works.

Please do not submit pull requests directly to the `main` branch of this project. Instead, use the `development` or `prerelease` branch as your target when submitting a pull request. If you have questions about how to do that, I would be more than happy to walk you through the steps over in the [discussions](https://github.com/SamErde/[Repository]/discussions)!
